AI Self-Improvement Framework
Overview
This is a full-stack web application that enables an AI to autonomously analyze, suggest, and implement improvements to its own codebase with human oversight. The system uses a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL database, and integrates with DeepSeek AI for code analysis and improvement suggestions.

System Architecture
The application follows a modern full-stack architecture:

Frontend: React with TypeScript, Vite build system, Tailwind CSS for styling
Backend: Node.js with Express.js server
Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
AI Integration: DeepSeek API for autonomous code analysis
Development Environment: Replit with hot reload and auto-deployment
Key Components
Frontend Architecture
React SPA: Single-page application with client-side routing using Wouter
UI Framework: Shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
State Management: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
Build Tool: Vite with TypeScript support
Backend Architecture
Express Server: RESTful API with middleware for logging and error handling
Database Layer: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for type-safe database operations
AI Services: Modular AI service layer for code analysis and suggestions
Storage Interface: Abstract storage layer with in-memory and database implementations
Database Schema
Users: Authentication and user management
Code Suggestions: AI-generated code improvement suggestions
Sandbox Tests: Testing environment for validating code changes
Activity Logs: System activity tracking (referenced but not fully implemented)
System Metrics: Performance and health monitoring (referenced but not fully implemented)
AI Integration
OpenAI/DeepSeek Service: Autonomous codebase scanning and improvement suggestions
Sandbox Environment: Safe testing environment for code changes using Node.js VM
Version Control: File backup and change management system
Data Flow
AI Analysis: The system autonomously scans the codebase for improvement opportunities
Suggestion Generation: DeepSeek AI generates detailed code suggestions with reasoning
Human Review: Suggestions are presented to users through the dashboard for approval
Sandbox Testing: Approved suggestions are tested in a safe sandbox environment
Implementation: Successfully tested changes are applied to the actual codebase
Version Control: All changes are backed up and tracked for potential rollback
